# Deployment Guide - ADmyBRAND Insights

## Quick Deployment to Vercel

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free tier available)
- Project pushed to GitHub repository

### Step-by-Step Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: ADmyBRAND Insights Dashboard"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/admybrand-insights.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Environment Variables** (Optional)
   If using PostgreSQL database:
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL connection string
   - Redeploy the project

### Build Configuration

The project includes a pre-configured `vercel.json` that handles:
- Frontend static build
- Backend serverless functions
- Proper routing for Single Page Application
- Environment configuration

### Automatic Deployments

Once connected to GitHub:
- Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- Real-time build logs and deployment status

## Alternative Deployment Platforms

### Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist/public`
4. Add environment variables in site settings

### Railway
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Railway auto-detects Node.js project
3. Add `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
4. Deploy automatically

### DigitalOcean App Platform
1. Create new app from GitHub
2. Configure build and run commands
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy and scale as needed

## Production Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Update README.md with correct repository URL
- [ ] Add proper environment variables
- [ ] Test build process locally
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Validate responsive design

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test all application features
- [ ] Verify real-time updates work
- [ ] Check export functionality (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Validate responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test dark/light theme switching
- [ ] Confirm navigation and animations

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Check bundle size optimization
- [ ] Verify image loading performance
- [ ] Test API response times
- [ ] Monitor error rates

## Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Purchase domain from registrar
2. Add domain in Vercel project settings
3. Configure DNS records:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to Vercel
   - Vercel handles SSL certificate automatically

### SSL Certificate
- Vercel provides automatic SSL certificates
- Custom domains get Let's Encrypt certificates
- HTTPS enforced by default

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Built-in Monitoring
- Vercel Analytics (usage and performance)
- Real-time function logs
- Error tracking and alerts
- Deployment history

### Additional Tools (Optional)
- Google Analytics for user tracking
- Sentry for error monitoring
- LogRocket for session recording
- Hotjar for user behavior analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Review build logs for specific errors

**Function Timeouts**
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching strategies
- Use proper async/await patterns

**Static File Issues**
- Verify build output in `dist/public`
- Check file paths and imports
- Ensure assets are properly bundled

### Support Resources
- Vercel Documentation: [vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
- GitHub Issues: Create issues for bugs or feature requests
- Community Support: Stack Overflow, Discord communities

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use Vercel environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security updates

### Application Security
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- CORS configuration for API endpoints
- Session security with secure cookies
- XSS protection with proper sanitization

This deployment guide ensures a smooth transition from development to production with minimal configuration required.
