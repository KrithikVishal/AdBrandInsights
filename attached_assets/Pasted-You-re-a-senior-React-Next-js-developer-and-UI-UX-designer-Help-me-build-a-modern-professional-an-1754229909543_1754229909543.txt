You're a senior React/Next.js developer and UI/UX designer. Help me build a modern, professional, and animation-rich analytics dashboard called "ADmyBRAND Insights" — an AI-powered platform for digital marketing agencies.

🎯 Core Dashboard Requirements:
1. **Overview Page** with:
   - 4 animated metric cards (Revenue, Users, Conversions, Growth %)
   - 3 interactive charts: Line, Bar, and Donut (use Chart.js, Recharts, or Nivo)
   - Responsive data table with sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Smooth animations using Framer Motion (card entrance, hover effects, loading states)
   - Real-time simulated updates using setInterval
   - Beautiful dark/light mode toggle with animated transitions

🎨 UI/UX Expectations:
- Use a modern UI library like shadcn/ui or Chakra UI + Tailwind CSS
- Consistent design system (spacing, typography, color scheme)
- Mobile-first responsive layout with breakpoints
- Clean visual hierarchy with clear information grouping
- Include micro-interactions, hover effects, and page/load transitions

⚙️ Technical Stack:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for styling & animations
- Mock data using `faker.js` or realistic static JSON
- Modular component architecture: MetricCard, ChartCard, DataTable, Layout, Sidebar, Topbar

🧩 ADDITIONAL PAGES (TABS) — Build out the following routes with page-specific features:

📈 **/campaigns** — Marketing Campaign Insights
- Campaign cards (with performance status: Running, Completed, Failed)

- Animated toast for new campaign creation (mocked)

🧑‍💻 **/audience** — Audience Intelligence
- Geographic heatmap (mock or placeholder)
- Demographics breakdown (age, gender, device type)
- Audience growth line chart
- Animated filters: Location, Segment, Source
- AI-generated persona suggestions (static text)

📊 **/reports** — Exportable AI Summaries
- Dynamic report builder with:
  - Chart selection + export as PDF/CSV
  - AI summary feed (hardcoded text)
  - Date-range selector with animated calendar
- Add loading skeletons while reports "generate"
- Floating action button (FAB) to generate PDF report

⚙️ **/settings** — User Preferences

- Notification toggle switches
- Animated theme color pickers
- Language selector dropdown with animation
- Option to reset dashboard layout

✨ Bonus Features to Include Across the App:
- Beautiful loading skeletons for all content blocks
- Sticky topbar with animated page titles
- Responsive sidebar with slide/fade transition
- Toast notifications (e.g. “Export completed”, “Campaign created”)
- Custom 404 and loading screens with motion
- Use Framer Motion `layoutId` for smooth page transitions

Start by scaffolding the app with a responsive sidebar layout and the `/overview` route. Then help me build reusable components (e.g., `<MetricCard />`, `<ChartCard />`, `<DataTable />`) with polished UI and animations.
